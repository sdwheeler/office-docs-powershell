# Remove-ThrottlingPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Remove-ThrottlingPolicy cmdlet to remove a non-default Microsoft Exchange throttling policy.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-ThrottlingPolicy [-Identity] <ThrottlingPolicyIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Force]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You can't remove the default client throttling policy. Also, you can't remove a policy associated with any users. For more information, see Example 2.

For more information about how to control the resources consumed by individual users, see [User workload management in Exchange Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/Exchange/server-health/workload-management).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-ThrottlingPolicy -Identity ClientThrottlingPolicy2
```

This example removes the user throttling policy ClientThrottlingPolicy2.

### Example 2
```powershell
$policy = Get-ThrottlingPolicy ClientThrottlingPolicy2

$mailboxes = Get-Mailbox | where-object {$_.ThrottlingPolicy -eq $policy.Identity}

$defaultPolicy = Get-ThrottlingPolicy | where-object {$_.IsDefault -eq $true}

foreach ($mailbox in $mailboxes) {Set-Mailbox -Identity $mailbox.Identity -ThrottlingPolicy $defaultPolicy}

Remove-ThrottlingPolicy ClientThrottlingPolicy2
```

You can't remove a policy that's associated with any users. This example reassigns the users subject to ClientThrottlingPolicy2 to the default policy. Then, it removes ClientThrottlingPolicy2.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The Identity parameter identifies the throttling policy you want to remove. Use the name that matches the name of the policy in Active Directory.

```yaml
Type: ThrottlingPolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

The DomainController parameter isn't supported on Edge Transport servers. An Edge Transport server uses the local instance of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS) to read and write data.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

You can use this switch to run tasks programmatically where prompting for administrative input is inappropriate.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
