# New-UMMailboxPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the New-UMMailboxPolicy cmdlet to create a Unified Messaging (UM) mailbox policy.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
New-UMMailboxPolicy [-Name] <String> -UMDialPlan <UMDialPlanIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The New-UMMailboxPolicy cmdlet creates a UM mailbox policy that has organization-wide scope. UM mailbox policies provide a set of policy values to be applied to UM-enabled users associated with a particular UM dial plan. UM mailbox policies are directly associated with UM dial plans. Therefore, the settings contained within a UM mailbox policy apply only to UM-enabled users of the UM dial plan that the UM mailbox policy is associated with. You can also use the New-UMMailboxPolicy cmdlet to create a UM mailbox policy template that can be used to create additional UM mailbox policies.

After this task is completed, a new UM mailbox policy is created.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
New-UMMailboxPolicy -Name MyUMMailboxPolicy -UMDialPlan MyUMDialPlan
```

This example creates the UM mailbox policy MyUMMailboxPolicy associated with the UM dial plan MyUMDialPlan.

## PARAMETERS

### -Name

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

The Name parameter specifies the display name for the UM mailbox policy. The name for the UM mailbox policy can contain as many as 64 characters.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -UMDialPlan

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

The UMDialPlan parameter specifies the identifier for the UM dial plan to be associated with the UM mailbox policy. This parameter is the directory object ID for the UM dial plan.

```yaml
Type: UMDialPlanIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
