# Import-JournalRuleCollection

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in on-premises Exchange.

Use the Import-JournalRuleCollection cmdlet to import journal rules from an XML file. You can import a journal rule collection you previously exported as a backup, or import rules you exported from an older version of Exchange.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Import-JournalRuleCollection [[-Identity] <RuleIdParameter>] [-FileData] <Byte[]>
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The Import-JournalRuleCollection cmdlet imports a journal rule collection you previously exported.

Importing a journal rule collection from an XML file removes or overwrites all pre-existing journal rules in your organization. Make sure that you have a backup of your current journal rule collection before you import and overwrite your current journal rules.

For more information about how to export a journal rule collection to an XML file, see [Export-JournalRuleCollection](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/exchangepowershell/export-journalrulecollection).

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Import-JournalRuleCollection -FileData ([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('C:\JournalRules\ExportedJournalRules.xml'))
```

This example imports journal rules from the XML file named ExportedJournalRules.xml in the C:\\JournalRules folder.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The Identity parameter specifies the name of a journal rule to be imported.

```yaml
Type: RuleIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -FileData

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The FileData parameter specifies the XML file that contains the exported journal rule collection from the Export-JournalRuleCollection cmdlet.

A valid value for this parameter requires you to read the file to a byte-encoded object using the following syntax: `([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('<Path>\<FileName>'))`. You can use this command as the parameter value, or you can write the output to a variable (`$data = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes('<Path>\<FileName>')`) and use the variable as the parameter value (`$data`).

```yaml
Type: Byte[]
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
