# Suspend-MailboxRestoreRequest

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service. Some parameters and settings may be exclusive to one environment or the other.

Use the Suspend-MailboxRestoreRequest cmdlet to suspend a restore request any time after the request was created, but before the request reaches the status of Completed. You can resume the restore request by using the Resume-MailboxRestoreRequest cmdlet.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Suspend-MailboxRestoreRequest [-Identity] <MailboxRestoreRequestIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-SuspendComment <String>]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Suspend-MailboxRestoreRequest -Identity "Ayla\MailboxRestore1"
```

This example suspends the second restore request for Ayla's mailbox with the identity Ayla\\MailboxRestore1.

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-MailboxRestoreRequest -Status InProgress | Suspend-MailboxRestoreRequest -SuspendComment "Resume after 10:00 PM"
```

This example suspends all restore requests that are in progress by using the Get-MailboxRestoreRequest cmdlet to retrieve all requests with a status of InProgress and then pipelines the output to the Suspend-MailboxRestoreRequest cmdlet with the suspend comment "Resume after 10:00 PM."

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The Identity parameter specifies the identity of the restore request. The Identity parameter consists of the alias of the mailbox to be restored and the name that was specified when the restore request was created. The identity of the restore request uses the following syntax: `Alias\Name`.

If you didn't specify a name for the restore request when it was created, Exchange automatically generated the default name MailboxRestore. Exchange generates up to 10 names, starting with MailboxRestore and then MailboxRestoreX (where X = 1-9).

```yaml
Type: MailboxRestoreRequestIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019

This parameter is available only in on-premises Exchange.

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SuspendComment

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The SuspendComment parameter specifies a description about why the request was suspended.

```yaml
Type: String
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010, Exchange Server 2013, Exchange Server 2016, Exchange Server 2019, Exchange Online

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
