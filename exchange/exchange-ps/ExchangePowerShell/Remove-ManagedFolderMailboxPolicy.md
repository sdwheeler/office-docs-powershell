# Remove-ManagedFolderMailboxPolicy

## SYNOPSIS
This cmdlet is available only in Exchange Server 2010.

Use the Remove-ManagedFolderMailboxPolicy cmdlet to delete managed folder mailbox policies.

For information about the parameter sets in the Syntax section below, see [Exchange cmdlet syntax](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/exchange-cmdlet-syntax).

## SYNTAX

```
Remove-ManagedFolderMailboxPolicy [-Identity] <MailboxPolicyIdParameter>
 [-Confirm]
 [-DomainController <Fqdn>]
 [-Force]
 [-WhatIf]
 [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
If you remove a managed folder mailbox policy that's applied to users' mailboxes, the affected mailboxes may no longer have retention settings. Therefore, before using this cmdlet to remove a policy, you should determine if the managed folder mailbox policy is applied to any users, and apply another policy to those users.

You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. Although this topic lists all parameters for the cmdlet, you may not have access to some parameters if they're not included in the permissions assigned to you. To find the permissions required to run any cmdlet or parameter in your organization, see [Find the permissions required to run any Exchange cmdlet](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/find-exchange-cmdlet-permissions).

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
Remove-ManagedFolderMailboxPolicy -Identity "My Managed Folder Mailbox Policy"
```

This example removes the managed folder mailbox policy My Managed Folder Mailbox Policy.

## PARAMETERS

### -Identity

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

The Identity parameter specifies the name, distinguished name (DN), or GUID of the managed folder mailbox policy.

```yaml
Type: MailboxPolicyIdParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Confirm

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

The Confirm switch specifies whether to show or hide the confirmation prompt. How this switch affects the cmdlet depends on if the cmdlet requires confirmation before proceeding.

- Destructive cmdlets (for example, Remove-\* cmdlets) have a built-in pause that forces you to acknowledge the command before proceeding. For these cmdlets, you can skip the confirmation prompt by using this exact syntax: `-Confirm:$false`.
- Most other cmdlets (for example, New-\* and Set-\* cmdlets) don't have a built-in pause. For these cmdlets, specifying the Confirm switch without a value introduces a pause that forces you acknowledge the command before proceeding.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: cf

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -DomainController

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

The DomainController parameter specifies the domain controller that's used by this cmdlet to read data from or write data to Active Directory. You identify the domain controller by its fully qualified domain name (FQDN). For example, dc01.contoso.com.

```yaml
Type: Fqdn
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Force

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

The Force switch hides warning or confirmation messages. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

This switch hides the confirmation prompt when the managed folder mailbox policy that's being removed is assigned to a mailbox user.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases:

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -WhatIf

> Applicable: Exchange Server 2010

The WhatIf switch simulates the actions of the command. You can use this switch to view the changes that would occur without actually applying those changes. You don't need to specify a value with this switch.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: wi

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```
